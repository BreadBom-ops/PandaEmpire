                               <h1>Overview and Diet of a Panda</h1>

<br>                               The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear native to South Central China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.
<br>
<br>
Consume 12-15 kg/day of bamboo roots, shoots, and leaves (26-33lbs)
<br>
<br>
Favor shoots (highly nutritious, low fiber, available during the spring), then young leaves (less fiber than other leaves)
<br>
<br>
Capable of eating up to 38kg (84 lbs) of "new" bamboo shoots
<br>
<br>
Abundance and access to quality bamboo, especially during the late winter and early spring, may be one limiting factor on populations in the wild (Li et al. 2017)
<br>
<br>
Much greater foraging effort required November-February; more time searcher for younger, more nutritious leaves
<br>
<br>
The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China. This bear also has a special significance for WWF because it has been our logo since our founding in 1961.
<br>
<br>
Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.
<br>
<br>
A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds, while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                Forest destruction reduces pandas' access to bamboo and prevents mating, and only about 61% of China's panda population is protected by reserves. WWF works with the Chinese government's National Conservation Program to protect the species' habitat.
                                WWF works to help local communities conserve the natural resources they depend upon; transform markets and policies toward sustainability; and protect and restore species and their habitats. Our efforts ensure that the value of nature is reflected in decision-making from a local to a global scale.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                WWF connects cutting-edge conservation science with the collective power of our partners in the field, more than 1 million supporters in the United States and 5 million globally, and our partnerships with communities, companies, and governments.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                Today, human activities put more pressure on nature than ever before, but it’s also humans who have the power to change this trajectory. Together, we can address the greatest threats to life on this planet and protect the natural resources that sustain and inspire us.

<h1>Where giant pandas live</h1> 

Wild giant pandas could once have been found throughout eastern and southern China, northern Vietnam and northern Myanmar. Now the pandas range is restricted to just six isolated mountain ranges in Gansu, Shaanxi and Sichuan Provinces in south-central China.
<br>
<br>
They live mainly in deciduous broadleaf, mixed conifer and sub-alpine coniferous forests between elevations of about 1,200-3,400 metres.

<h2>Why giant pandas are so important to Nature</h2>
Giant pandas help to keep their mountain forests healthy by spreading seeds in their droppings, which helps vegetation to thrive.

The panda’s forest environment is also important for local people – for food, income and fuel for cooking and heating. Giant pandas live in the mountain catchment areas of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, whose river basins are the economic heart of China, home to over half a billion people.

<br>
<br>

Panda habitat rivals the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem in the world. It's also vitally important for other threatened and endangered species, including golden snub-nosed monkeys, takins, red pandas and snow leopards. 
<br>
<br>

By protecting pandas we’re helping conserve the wider environment, for the people and wildlife that depend on it.

    <h1>Ecological Information from a Scientist point of view</h1>

    Ecologically speaking, giant pandas, Ailuropoda melanoleuca (which translates to "black and white cat-foot"), are a mere shadow of what they once were. They are now are restricted to a highly fragmented geographic range between 2000–3000 meters (6600-9800 feet) in elevation in south-central China, but historically, they occupied a much larger and more continuous range throughout most of southern and eastern China. Further, panda fossils indicate they once lived as far south as northern Myanmar and northern Viet Nam and northward nearly to Beijing. Although their closest relatives are carnivores, pandas are specialised on a diet of low-quality bamboo. With the exception of mothers with cubs, adult pandas are solitary animals and are known to roam widely through low- and mid-elevation forests at various times of the year.

<h1>Why are pandas black and white?</h1>
(Snippet from a Forbes Article)
Based on this study, the research team proposed another working hypothesis for the panda's remarkable pelage: the giant panda's body coloration provides it some camouflage in either snowy or shadowy habitats, whereas its facial markings are used for communication

<h1>Why are Pandas so cute and adorable (In a scientific manner)</h1>

    Neuroscientists speculate that their snub noses, generous cheeks and toddling gaits may excite circuitry in our brains normally related to interactions with human infants. Likewise, babies have supersized eyes, and pandas’ trademark black patches make their eyes appear larger by a factor of ten. (Part of a “facial mask” that likely evolved to repel predators, the eye patches seem to have the opposite effect on us.) Pandas are also one of the only animals to have a pseudo-thumb, a flexible wrist bone that allows them to manipulate objects in a cunning manner. They can stand on their hind legs, they like to frolic in the snow—the list goes on. They even somersault.
